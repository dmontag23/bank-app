// TODO: See if it is possible to write detox e2e tests for error conditions
// It is not trivial - it may require somehow mocking modules following https://wix.github.io/Detox/docs/guide/mocking
// but note that these mocks would then apply to all Detox tests, so it is not obvious how to do dynamic mocking.
// Another option could be to use the launch args of the app to launch the app in "error mode", but this would
// likely mean modifying the app code just to be able to test it, which isn't nice.
// Also worth following https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues/3986
